# TrendingFireIOS

Trending Fire is an IOS mobile application, where users can swipe left or right through user generated 'cards'. Each card consists of an image and description. Each card is assigned a 'rank'; a swipe left will influence the rank by -1, and a swipe right will influence the rank by +1. Each user can only influence each card once. Additionally, the rank of the card will also affect the rank of the user who created the card. Users can also save cards to their profile by swiping up.
